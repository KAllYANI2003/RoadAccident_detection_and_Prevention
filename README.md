![images](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d6dacf0-ef8b-4f86-a342-2c2725c03c87)


This project aims to detect, analyze, and help prevent road accidents in the Northeast region of India using real-time and historical data. Leveraging data analytics, machine learning, and geospatial insights, the system helps in identifying accident-prone zones (hotspots), predicting risk levels, and suggesting preventive measures to ensure safer transportation.


🎯 Objective
1.To build a predictive model that detects and forecasts road accident risks using real-time and past accident data.

2.To identify accident hotspots in Northeast Indian states.

3.To recommend preventive strategies to reduce road accidents using intelligent analytics.

4.To visualize the patterns of accidents over time, location, and severity.


🌐 Scope
The project is focused on the eight northeastern states of India: Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, and Sikkim.

🧰 Tech Stack
Python

Pandas & NumPy – for data preprocessing

Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly – for visualization

Scikit-learn – for machine learning models

Folium / Geopandas – for interactive map visualizations

Flask / Streamlit (optional) – for real-time dashboard or web deployment


📦 Dataset
Real-time or historic accident data collected from:

Government portals (e.g., data.gov.in)

Traffic police reports

Public APIs / Sensor data (if integrated)

Key features include:

Date & time of accident

Location (latitude/longitude, district, highway, etc.)

Type of accident (collision, vehicle type)

Weather & road condition (if available)

Fatality, injury severity


🔍 Features
📌 Accident Heatmap – Interactive visualization of high-risk zones.

📊 Time-Series Analysis – Trends based on month, day, or hour.

🧠 Machine Learning Prediction Model – Classifies accident risk levels (High, Medium, Low).

🚦 Prevention Module – Insights and recommendations for authorities and drivers.

📱 (Optional) Web Dashboard – Real-time visual interface for monitoring.



📈 ML Approach
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Feature Engineering – Time, location encoding, etc.

Model Training – Using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or XGBoost.

Model Evaluation – Accuracy, Precision, Confusion Matrix.

Deployment Ready – Pickle model for inference with new real-time data.
